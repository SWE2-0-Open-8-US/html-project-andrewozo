          Hello, I'm Andrew! I am a full-stack Engineer based in New York City.
          After studying the hardware side of tech as an Electrical Engineer
          student, I decided to switch from a breadboard to a keyboard and learn
          how to build things on the web. Since middle school, I have developed
          a passion for collecting sneakers, while my lifelong fascination with
          cars centers on Japanese and European models. I am also a NY sports
          fan, specifically of the Knicks, Mets, and Giants.
